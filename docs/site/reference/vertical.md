Every viewer plots against one vertical coordinate. The `verticalKey`
trait selects which data column that is. Two coordinates carry built-in
display defaults:

| Key | Meaning | Direction | Axis label | Readout format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `depth` | depth below surface, in m | positive down | `depth [m]` | `.2f` |
| `nap` | elevation in m NAP | positive up | `NAP [m]` | `+.2f` |

The widgets never see datums. Compute `nap` on the Python side as the
surface elevation minus the depth. Express annotation `at` values, layer
`top` and `bottom` values, and the vertical `axisLimits` entry in the
selected coordinate.

## Vertical

`Vertical` binds a data column to the vertical coordinate. It mirrors
[`Channel`](/docs/cpt-anywidget/reference/cpt-viewer/#channel): only
`key` is required, and omitted fields fall back to defaults. Pass one
anywhere a vertical key string goes, to plot against a datum the package
does not know:

```python
from cpt_anywidget import Vertical

CPTViewer(df, vertical=Vertical("taw", label="TAW [m]", up=True, format="+.2f"))
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | str | The column name in the data. Required. |
| `label` | str | The full axis title, for example `"NAP [m]"`. Default: the key. |
| `up` | bool | `True` for a positive-up coordinate (elevation), `False` for positive down (depth). Default for an unknown key: `False`. |
| `format` | str | A [d3-format](https://d3js.org/d3-format) string for readouts, for example `"+.2f"`. |

The direction matters twice. It sets the sort order at intake — the
shallowest sample must render first. And it orients the vertical
`limits` pair.

## to_vertical

```python
to_vertical(depth, offset, vertical_key)
```

Converts a depth below surface to the selected vertical coordinate.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `depth` | float or None | Meters below surface, positive down. `None` (a missing sample) passes through. |
| `offset` | float | The surface elevation in the target datum. Only used for positive-up coordinates. |
| `vertical_key` | str, `Vertical`, or dict | The target coordinate. A depth-like key returns the depth unchanged. A positive-up key (`"nap"`, or `up=True`) returns `offset - depth`. |

Use it at the widget boundary, for example to place an annotation at
1.5 m below a surface at NAP +2.1 m:

```python
from cpt_anywidget import to_vertical

at = to_vertical(1.5, 2.1, "nap")   # 0.6
```

## from_vertical

```python
from_vertical(value, offset, vertical_key)
```

Converts a value in the selected vertical coordinate back to depth below
surface — the inverse of [`to_vertical`](#to_vertical). Use it to read
`editedLayers` boundaries back into depths.
