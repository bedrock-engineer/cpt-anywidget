`CPTViewer` shows one CPT. It plots measurement channels against a
shared, zoomable vertical axis. Around the plot, it can show:

- horizontal reference lines (annotations),
- polylines in a channel's coordinates (overlays),
- read-only soil-interpretation columns,
- a nearby borehole log,
- an editable layer column that syncs edits back to Python.

```python
from cpt_anywidget import CPTViewer, Channel

CPTViewer(
    df,
    vertical="depth",
    channels=["coneResistance", "localFriction", Channel("qn", unit="MPa")],
    limits={"coneResistance": (0, 30)},
)
```

## Constructor

```python
CPTViewer(data=None, *, vertical=None, channels=None, limits=None, **kwargs)
```

The constructor is a facade over the [traits](#traits). It normalizes
Python-friendly values into the JSON wire format. You can also pass any
trait directly as a keyword argument. Data passed raw via `cptData=`
skips the intake step.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data` | DataFrame or dict | Tidy columns: one row per depth sample, one column per measurement. Accepts a polars or pandas DataFrame, or a dict of equal-length lists. Goes through [`tidy`](/docs/cpt-anywidget/reference/intake/#tidy): samples become JSON-safe, and rows sort into render order. |
| `vertical` | str, `Vertical`, or dict | The column that holds the vertical coordinate. Must be present in `data`. `"depth"` sorts ascending, `"nap"` descending. See [`Vertical`](/docs/cpt-anywidget/reference/vertical/). |
| `channels` | list | The channels to plot, in axis stacking order. Mix column-name strings, [`Channel`](#channel) bindings, and raw dicts. |
| `limits` | dict | `{column: (min, max)}` axis overrides. The vertical pair may come in either order; the constructor orients it to the render direction. |
| `**kwargs` | | Trait names pass through unchanged: `annotations=`, `interpretations=`, `borehole=`, … |

## Channel

`Channel` binds a data column to a plotted channel. The data keeps its
own column names; the binding adapts the chart. Only `key` is required.
Omitted fields fall back to the built-in display defaults.

```python
from cpt_anywidget import Channel

Channel("qn", label="qn", unit="MPa", color="tomato", side="bottom")
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | str | The column name in the data. Required. |
| `label` | str | The axis label. Default: the key. |
| `unit` | str | The unit shown on the axis and in readouts. |
| `color` | str | Any CSS color. Default: a palette color. |
| `side` | str | `"bottom"` or `"top"`: which side the x axis stacks on. Default: `"bottom"`. |

### Built-in channel defaults

Columns with these names need no binding:

| Column | Label | Unit | Side |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `coneResistance` | qc | MPa | bottom |
| `localFriction` | fs | MPa | bottom |
| `porePressureU1` | u1 | MPa | bottom |
| `porePressureU2` | u2 | MPa | bottom |
| `frictionRatio` | Rf | % | top |
| `inclination` | incl | ° | top |

Bottom axes stack left to right. Top axes stack right to left.

## Traits

The traits are the JSON wire format between Python and the browser. Every
trait syncs live: set a trait on an existing widget and the chart
updates.

### `cptData` — dict

The measurement data: `{"depth": [...], "coneResistance": [...], ...}`.
Each key is a column name. Each value is a list of samples. All lists
have equal length. Use `None` for a missing sample — NaN is not valid
JSON and breaks the sync. The first sample renders at the top.

Prefer the `data` constructor argument, which enforces this contract.

### `verticalKey` — str or dict

The `cptData` column that is the vertical coordinate. Default:
`"depth"`. `"depth"` (positive down) and `"nap"` (positive up) carry
built-in display defaults. A `{"key", "label"?, "up"?, "format"?}` dict
binds any other column. See
[`Vertical`](/docs/cpt-anywidget/reference/vertical/).

### `channels` — list

The channels to plot, in axis stacking order. Entries are a column key
or a `{"key", "label"?, "unit"?, "color"?, "side"?}` dict. Overrides
merge over the built-in defaults. Unknown keys add new plottable
channels. An empty list plots all built-in channels present in the data.

### `axisLimits` — dict

Per-channel `[min, max]` axis overrides, for example
`{"coneResistance": [0, 30], "depth": [0, 25]}`. Key the vertical
override by the `verticalKey`. Explicit limits are honored exactly.
Omitted channels fall back to the data-driven min and max.

### `annotations` — list

Horizontal reference lines, for example a groundwater level:

```python
[{"at": 1.2, "label": "GWL", "color": "steelblue", "dash": "4 2",
  "position": "right", "offset": [0, -4]}]
```

`at` is a value in the current vertical coordinate. `position` is
`"left"`, `"center"`, or `"right"`. `offset` moves the label by
`[dx, dy]` pixels.

### `overlays` — list

Polylines drawn in a channel's x coordinate against the vertical axis,
for example a fitted hydrostatic pore-pressure line:

```python
[{"channel": "porePressureU2", "points": [[0.0, 1.2], [0.5, 6.0]],
  "color": "black", "dash": "2 2", "width": 1}]
```

`points` are `[x, v]` pairs: x in the channel's unit, v in the current
vertical coordinate. An overlay whose channel is not plotted is skipped.

### `interpretations` — list

Read-only interpretation columns, stacked right of the plot:

```python
[{"label": "Robertson",
  "layers": [{"top": 0.0, "bottom": 2.4, "label": "sand", "color": "#f4e04d"}]}]
```

`top` and `bottom` are values in the current vertical coordinate.

### `borehole` — dict

A nearby borehole log, rendered left of the plot on the shared axis:

```python
{"label": "BHR000000123456",
 "layers": [{"top": 1.2, "bottom": -0.8, "label": "klei",
             "bands": [{"x1": 0, "x2": 1, "color": "#78a86c", "hatch": "/"}]}]}
```

Each layer holds proportional soil-composition `bands` with x in
`[0, 1]` and an optional matplotlib-style `hatch` character. An empty
dict `{}` hides the column.

The borehole and the CPT have different surface elevations. Express
both in a shared datum such as NAP — convert with
[`to_vertical`](/docs/cpt-anywidget/reference/vertical/#to_vertical).
See
[`layers_from_bhrgt`](/docs/cpt-anywidget/reference/borehole-viewer/#layers_from_bhrgt)
for the band shape.

### `editedLayers` — list, bidirectional

The manually editable layer column, stacked after the interpretation
columns:

```python
[{"top": 0.0, "bottom": 2.4, "class": "sand"}]
```

`top` and `bottom` follow the same convention as an interpretation
column. `class` references a [`soil_classes`](#soil_classes--list) entry by
name and drives the fill and the label. Explicit `color` and `label` are
fallbacks for classless layers only.

The front end writes edits back to this trait. Observe it to read the
user's picks:

```python
viewer.observe(lambda change: store(change["new"]), names="editedLayers")
```

In the widget, the user can:

- drag a boundary to move it,
- click in the lane beside the column to split a layer there,
- click the × near a boundary to merge two layers (the upper layer keeps
  its class),
- click a layer to pick its class from a pie menu.

### `soil_classes` — list

The soil-class palette, the single source of truth for layer colors:

```python
[{"name": "sand", "color": "#f4e04d", "label": "Sand"}]
```

Layers reference an entry via their `class` key. Override this trait to
change the classes or colors project-wide. Default: gravel, sand, silt,
clay, peat.

### `width`, `height` — int

The plot size in pixels. `0` (the default) falls back to 400×800. Layer
columns widen the widget beyond `width`.
